    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Today, I would like to introduce you to Vali High-Security Server, a cutting-edge system that employs a comprehensive approach to protect against advanced hacking attempts.
        Vali utilizes seven layers of protection, each designed to fortify the server's defenses and ensure the utmost security.
        Let's delve into the details of each layer and understand how Vali safeguards against potential breaches.
    </p>

    <div class="flowchart">
        <div class="flowchart-item">
            <h3>First Layer: Rootkits (Foundation)</h3>
            <div class="flowchart-item-description">
                The initial layer establishes a strong foundation using rootkits, which provide a hidden presence on the server.
                Rootkits create a starting point for subsequent layers, ensuring that Vali operates covertly and efficiently in defending against attackers.
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="flowchart-item">
            <h3>Second Layer: Encryption and Firewalls</h3>
            <div class="flowchart-item-description">
                Vali incorporates advanced encryption techniques and robust firewalls to fortify its defenses.
                These measures protect sensitive data and create barriers to deter and mitigate unauthorized access attempts.
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="flowchart-item">
            <h3>Third Layer: Stealth</h3>
            <div class="flowchart-item-description">
                The third layer focuses on stealthy behavior, making it arduous for attackers to detect and bypass Vali's defenses.
                By operating stealthily, Vali effectively hides its presence, thereby increasing the complexity and challenges for potential attackers.
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="flowchart-item">
            <h3>Fourth Layer: Code Obfuscation</h3>
            <div class="flowchart-item-description">
                To hinder hackers' attempts to analyze or tamper with Vali's code, the fourth layer involves obfuscation.
                Code obfuscation obscures the server's code, making it difficult to understand and manipulate, further enhancing the security of the system.
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="flowchart-item">
            <h3>Fifth Layer: AI-Based Intelligence</h3>
            <div class="flowchart-item-description">
                Vali's fifth layer incorporates an AI-based intelligence tool that constantly learns from past attacks.
                By comprehending hacker tricks and tactics, Vali adapts its defenses accordingly, staying one step ahead of potential threats.
                This layer ensures that Vali remains proactive and continuously evolves to counter emerging attack vectors.
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="flowchart-item">
            <h3>Vali Prepares Defense System</h3>
            <div class="flowchart-item-description">
                Based on the gathered information and intelligence from previous attacks, Vali meticulously prepares its defense system.
                By leveraging its AI-driven insights, Vali optimizes its security measures to counter specific threats and vulnerabilities.
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="flowchart-item">
            <h3>Sixth Layer: Code Injection</h3>
            <div class="flowchart-item-description">
                In the sixth layer, Vali executes its code on the attacker's machine, leveraging seemingly harmless images to inject its defensive mechanisms.
                This method allows Vali to gain control over the attacker's system, redirecting their resources towards stopping attacks on the main server.
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="flowchart-item">
            <h3>Seventh Layer: Utilizing Rootkits and Covert Techniques</h3>
            <div class="flowchart-item-description">
                Operating silently and covertly, Vali employs rootkits and similar techniques in the seventh layer.
                By utilizing these resources on the attacker's machine, Vali effectively neutralizes their capacity to harm the main server, providing an additional layer of defense.
